This bot allows you to have added customization to your github pushes to update your community or friends on what is happening behind the scenes

GitHub to Discord Webhooks only allows up to 5 Commits to be displayed in one embed. As well, it cuts texts when it exceeds a certain ammount of characters in each push

Using this bot will allow you to customise the logs however you want them too look like! (with discord limitations)
## ðŸ“‘ Future Features
Currently the bot only handles push events, later will be adding Issues, PRs and Automations
